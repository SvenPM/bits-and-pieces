# bits-and-pieces
Just some code pieces I found useful, they come with absolutely no warranties. I only put them together for my Linux setup and they are working fine there. I am doing this just for fun and to learn some scripting.

# Openbox Stuff
These scripts were done for [a series of blog posts about Openbox on Ubuntu 14.04](https://buntu4win.wordpress.com/tag/openbox/), but in theory they should work on other systems as well.

* (Screen saver/lock](https://github.com/SvenPM/bits-and-pieces/tree/master/screensaver)
  
  A screen saver/lock with power saving ability for Openbox (and maybe other WMs) based on gnome-screensaver, xautolock, scrot and imagemagick
  * locker.sh (main script)
  * cappuccino.sh (toggle)

* [Nitrogenium](https://github.com/SvenPM/bits-and-pieces/tree/master/wallpaperrandomizer)
  
  A wallpaper randomizer based on  Nitrogen
  * nitrogenium.sh (main script)
  * auto-nitro.sh (automatic changing)
