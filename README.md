Just some code pieces I found useful, they come with absolutely no warranties. I only put them together for my Linux setup and they are working fine there.

Openbox Stuff

  A screen saver/lock with power saving ability for Openbox (and maybe other WMs) based on gnome-screensaver, xautolock, scrot and imagemagick

  A wallpaper randomizer based on  Nitrogen
  * nitrogenium.sh (main script)
